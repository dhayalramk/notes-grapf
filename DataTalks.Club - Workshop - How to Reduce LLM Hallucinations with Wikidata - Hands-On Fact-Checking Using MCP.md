#### Content Details
LLMs often hallucinate when working with entities and factual claims. In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore how to ground LLM outputs using Wikidata and MCP, and how to move beyond LLM-only approaches toward evidence-based verification.  
  
In this session, you’ll learn how to:

- Use Wikidata as a structured source for factual verification
- Set up and query Wikidata via MCP
- Verify claims with MCP + an LLM
- Move beyond pure GenAI to evidence-driven pipelines
- Find relevant Wikidata statements with semantic search
- Rerank candidate evidence with an LLM
- Validate claims using an NLI model

Register to join live and learn how to make LLM systems more reliable and inspectable.
