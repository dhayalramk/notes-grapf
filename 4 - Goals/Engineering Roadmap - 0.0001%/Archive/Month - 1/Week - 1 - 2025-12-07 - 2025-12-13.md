### Reset the foundation: think like a systems engineer, not just a coder.

### Week 1 - Overview (Phase 1: Foundations)

**Primary Goal:**  
Build rock-solid mental models for:
- Time & space complexity
- Core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash maps)
- Execution model basics (CPU, process, thread, context switch)
- Networking big picture (just enough to map where code actually runs)

**Secondary Goal:**  
Lock in a **daily study ritual** and **note-taking system** you’ll keep for the next 14 months.
