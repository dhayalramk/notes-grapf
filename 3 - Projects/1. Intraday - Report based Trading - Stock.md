## Introduction

> **An automated pipeline that reads BSE reports in real time, evaluates their intraday impact, and triggers rule-based algo trades on stocks.**

---
## High-Level Flow

> Fetch BSE Reports -> Meaning Analysis -> Impact Score -> Algo Rules -> Buy / Sell / Ignore -> Trade Summary

## Layers

1. Fetch BSE Reports and Preserve
2. Find meaningful Analysis | Can Take (or) Ignore 
3. Algo Engine | API: addStock, Process: Algo based Buy/Sell Intraday for the Dynamic Stock  addition
4. Trade Given Information | Stock, Quantity, Buy/Sell - with tag
5. Trade summary based on the tag
